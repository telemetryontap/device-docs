1. Click the Wi-Fi icon, then select the arrow. You will then see a list of networks
appear. You may need to wait for a minute as Windows populates the list. If the
environment has many wireless devices or devices that may interfere with
wireless signal, then it may be necessary to attach an external antenna to the
NTap device.
