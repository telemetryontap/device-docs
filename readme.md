# Device Documentation

## Device Documentation

This section provides detailed information about the various Telemetry On Tap devices, including setup instructions, configuration options, and device parameters. Each device has its own dedicated page with comprehensive guides and troubleshooting tips.

Device documentation is broken down into three categories:

- [Devices](https://device.docs.telemetryontap.com/devices/devices.md)
- [Firmware](https://device.docs.telemetryontap.com/firmware/firmware.md)
- [Hardware](https://device.docs.telemetryontap.com/hardware/hardware.md)


We are working hard to migrate our documentation to a new format here. If you have any questions or need assistance, please reach out to our team.
