## Step 2: Scroll Down

You may need to scroll down to see the **ADD INGREDIENT** button (marked in orange at the bottom of the screenshot above). Swipe up on the screen until you see it.

## Step 3: Tap Add Ingredient

Tap the blue **ADD INGREDIENT** button. A new ingredient card will appear in the list.

## Step 4: Set Up the New Ingredient

Fill in the details for the new ingredient:

1. **Source** - Tap the Source dropdown and pick which ingredient to add (for example, "Caramel" or "Milk"). This list shows all the sources that are set up on the machine.

2. **Quantity (Oz)** - Use the **+** and **-** buttons to set how much of this ingredient to use (in ounces).

3. **Flow Rate (%)** - Drag the slider to set how fast this ingredient pours. If you are not sure, start at **100%**.

4. **Tag** - Pick when this ingredient should pour. See the tag guide below.

5. **Hide** - Choose whether the customer sees this ingredient on the pour screen. Set to **Visible** to show it, or **Hidden** to keep it out of the customer's ingredient list. The ingredient still pours either way.

## Step 5: Pick the Right Tag

The **Tag** controls when the ingredient pours during the drink. The machine pours a drink in stages, with a brief pause between each stage.

| Tag | When It Pours | Use It For |
|-----|--------------|------------|
| **Base** | Stage 1 (first) | The main liquid in the drink (milk, water, soda water) |
| **Base Mix** | Stage 1 (first) | What mixes with the base to make the drink (coffee, soda syrup) |
| **None** | Stage 1 (first) | Extra flavors that go in during the first pour (vanilla, caramel) |
| **Stage 2** | Stage 2 (after a pause) | Toppings or layers added after the main drink (cream topper) |
| **Stage 3** | Stage 3 (last) | Anything added at the very end |

### Examples

**Iced Latte:**
- Milk = **Base** (the main liquid)
- Cold Brew Coffee = **Base Mix** (mixes with milk to make the latte)

**Vanilla Coke with Cream:**
- Soda Water = **Base** (the main liquid)
- Cola Syrup = **Base Mix** (mixes with soda water to make the coke)
- Vanilla = **None** (extra flavor, pours with the first stage)
- Cream = **Stage 2** (pours after a pause to create a cream topper)

> **Tip:** If you are adding a simple flavor to a drink (like vanilla or caramel), set the Tag to **None**. If you are adding a topper or layer that should go on after the main drink, use **Stage 2**.

## Step 6: Check the Other Ingredients

After you add a new ingredient, you may want to lower the amounts of the other ingredients. This keeps the total drink size about the same.

**Example:** If you add 0.5 oz of a new flavor to a recipe, you might want to reduce another ingredient by 0.5 oz so the cup does not overflow.

## When You Are Done

Tap the **X** in the top-right corner to close the recipe editor. Your changes are saved.
