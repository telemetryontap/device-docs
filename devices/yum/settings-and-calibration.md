Tap any source to see its details.

![Source Editor](../images/source_edit.png)

Each source shows:

| Field | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|
| **Name** | The name of the ingredient |
| **Container Size** | How many ounces are in a full container |
| **Shelf Life Days** | How many days the product stays fresh |
| **Low Product (oz)** | The machine warns you when this much product is left |
| **Max Dispense Rate** | How fast the ingredient pours (slider, 0-100%) |

There are also two buttons at the bottom:

- **BEGIN CALIBRATION** - Starts the calibration process (see below)
- **DISPENSE PRODUCT** - Pours this ingredient from the tap (used for cleaning and testing)

## Calibration

> **Warning:** Calibration is an advanced feature. It is **not** part of regular day-to-day use. Only use calibration if a drink is pouring the wrong amount, or if you have been told to calibrate by your support team.

Calibration helps the machine measure how fast an ingredient flows. This makes sure the right amount comes out when you pour a drink.

### What You Will Need

- A container with an **8 oz marking** on it
- The container must be safe for the product being dispensed

### How to Calibrate

1. Open **Settings** > **Sources** and tap the source you want to calibrate.

2. Tap the **BEGIN CALIBRATION** button at the bottom of the screen.

3. **Step 1 - Begin Calibration:** Read the instructions on screen. You will need a container with an 8 oz mark. Tap **NEXT** when ready.
