## Step 2: Find the Ingredient You Want to Remove

Each ingredient has a card with its name, amount, and settings. Look for the ingredient you want to remove.

## Step 3: Tap the Trash Icon

In the top-right corner of each ingredient card, there is a **trash icon** (marked in red in the screenshot above). Tap it to remove that ingredient from the recipe.

> **Warning:** The ingredient is removed right away. There is no "Are you sure?" prompt. If you remove an ingredient by mistake, you will need to add it back manually. See [Add an Ingredient](add-ingredient.md).

## Step 4: Check the Remaining Ingredients

After you remove an ingredient, the drink will pour less liquid than before. You may want to increase the amounts of the remaining ingredients to make up for it.

**Example:** If you remove an ingredient that was 1 oz, you might want to add that 1 oz to another ingredient so the drink stays the same total size.

See [Change Ingredient Amounts](adjust-volume.md) for how to adjust the amounts.

## When You Are Done

Tap the **X** in the top-right corner to close the recipe editor. Your changes are saved.
